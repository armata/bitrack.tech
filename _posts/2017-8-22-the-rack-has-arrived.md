title: The rack has arrived!
---

After months of searching for an affordable rack, I've finally acquired a Digitus 22U rack.

The side rails can be customized depth-wise. However, you have to account for the connectors on the front.

Sadly it looks like an APC rackmount UPS won't fit (SUA1500RMI2U) but I'll get a normal one and a shelf.
