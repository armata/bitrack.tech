title: Fixing the telephone wiring
---

Today I took up the task of replacing the old telephone wires (a power cable, in fact).

There were 2 problems with the old wiring:

* the wire used was a 2 core power cable
* the second telephone line wasn't connected

I bought 10 meters of German-made 2 pair telephone cable in Bauhaus and made some improvements. Here's a picture of the fixed wiring:

(sorry for the rotated picture)

As you can see, I've properly grounded the wire and connected the second telephone line too.

The result is a great success -- the attainable rate has changed from ~9000/38000 to ~10000/42000:

Currently this doesn't mean anything to me as I have a 20 down, 2 up package but it will be of great importance in the future when I get a business account and configure MLPPP.
